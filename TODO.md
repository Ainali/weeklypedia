# TODO

* javascript injection (for navigation)
* cross-namespace talk pages (talk pages across all namespaces, low pri)
* relative growth (# weekly revisions vs total)
* total number of talk pages edited
* permalink to archive post for current issue
* "from the long tail" (relatively heavily-edited articles older than a couple years old)
* Hashtags
* "Other Current Events on Wikipedia" (pages not featured elsewhere but in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Current_events , https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kategorie:Wikipedia:Laufendes_Ereignis , etc.)
* Number of total new articles

## Localization

* Add 'local' object to render context
  * Add localized full language name
  * Add localized date
* Strip HTML from strings for text only l10nizing
  * Should links be handled differently?
* Make rendering look for English fallbacks
* Localize email and archive HTML
* Decide what to do with text-only first/last lines
* Still no good story for the customizable intro text (markdown?)
